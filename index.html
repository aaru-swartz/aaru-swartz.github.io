		<h2>Aaru Swartz</h2><br>
		<br>
		<p>Myself Aaru-Swartz. Yeah... that's a strange name.<br>
		<h3>But why Aaru Swartz?...</h3> To be honest there is nothing much interesting about the name. The initial of my name was "R" which represented my father's name.<br>
Friends started calling "R" instead of my name . Hence "Aaru" which representes "R". And Swartz...Many of you might know Aaron Swart(The Internet's  Own Boy).<br>
I came to know about him one day. And started reading about him. And was very much attracted by his ideas and thoughts. Hence the name Swartz.</p>
